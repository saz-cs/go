# Day 3 of GoLang - Learning Journey ðŸš€

## **Key Takeaways** ðŸ“š

- **Nested functions are not allowed**  
  Functions cannot be nested in Go unless they are **anonymous functions**.

- **Function declaration restriction**  
  Function declarations are not allowed inside the `main` function.

- **Function signature variable initialization**  
  Variables to be returned can be **initialized directly in the function signature**.

- **Multiple return values**  
  Functions can return **multiple values**, enhancing versatility.

- **Blank identifier (`_`)**  
  The `_` symbol is used to **ignore a value returned** by a function.

- **Recursion and function calls**  
  Functions can call **other functions** or themselves recursively.

- **Function expressions**  
  Functions can be written as **expressions** or **anonymous functions**, but only inside `main`.

- **Higher-order functions**  
  Functions can accept other functions as arguments or **return functions**.

- **`defer` keyword**  
  The `defer` keyword delays execution until the **surrounding function returns**.

- **Supports pointers**  
  Go supports **pointers**, allowing efficient memory manipulation.

- **Slices and Maps are passed by reference**  
  By default, **slices** and **maps** are passed by **reference**, not value.

- **Printing structs with `%+v`**  
  Use `fmt.Printf("%+v")` to print **structs with field names and values**.

- **Go's declaration quirks**  
  Go offers **many ways** to declare and initialize variables, which can be **confusing**.

- **Methods as functions**  
  Methods are functions that include a **receiver** as their first argument.

- **Interfaces**  
  Interfaces define **method signatures** and are **implicitly implemented** by methods without needing explicit extension.
