# Day 2 of Go lang
## New things I learned
- allows only one main function per package/directory/folder
- **else** keyword should be exactly beside the **}** of **if** block, otherwise compiler throws error
- if the condition is not mentioned beside switch, **conditional expression** should be written at each switch case
- **implicitly** adds break statement at the **end** of switch case's block
- the **'fallthrough'** keyword
- has only **'for'** loop, which can also be written in **'while'** manner
- In arrays, len  = cap
- In slices, len != cap
